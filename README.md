Pause: Pause the currently playing song.
Stop: Stop the currently playing song and reset to the beginning.
Next: Skip to the next song in the playlist.
Previous: Go back to the previous song in the playlist.
Resume: Resume the paused song from where it was paused.
Song Collection: A folder containing MP3 songs should be selected.
